SUBJECT: Impossible to Implement Player Interface given Proposed Strategy

We have determined that Player interface provided to us is impossible to
implement given the proposed decision strategy.

The decision strategy includes the following: “[T]he player’s strategy is to
place the card with the highest face value when it is its turn, regardless of
the stacks on the table. When it must pick up a stack from the table, it
naturally picks up the stack with the fewest number of bull points.”

The interface specification requires the player to choose a stack to pick
up at the time that they choose a card to play. One of the test cases clearly
shows that an ID for a stack to pick up should be returned if the given
card's face value is smaller than all of the cards on top of the four stacks
at the time the card is chosen.

The game rules specify that all players must pick a card before any of the
cards are placed on the stacks, and therefore the player cannot reliably know
what the stacks will look like when its card is placed. This means that the
player will not always be able to choose the stack with the lowest number
of bull points.

As a result of the issue described above, we have determined that it is
impossible to implement a player that would follow the desired strategy
and at the same time conform to the provided interface.
