1. Main Components of the Game

Dealer:
    Keeps track of the cards and facilitates the game rounds.
    - deck: List of TraitCard (122)
    - discard pile: List of TraitCard
    - players : List of Player


Player:
    Keeps track of a player's species and food bag, offloads decisions
    to the PlayerAgent
    - species: List of SpeciesBoard
    - food bag: Natural number
    - agent: PlayerAgent

PlayerAgent:
    Makes decisions when asked by the Player


2. Other Data Types

WateringHole:
    Keeps track of the number of food tokens in the game, as well
    as discarded cards.
    - food tokens: Natural number
    - trait cards: List of TraitCard

SpeciesBoard:
    Represents a Species in the game, stores the food, population and
    body sizes, as well as Trait cards.
    - food: Number (0, 7) ? in/exclusive
    - population size: Number (0, 7) ? in/exclusive
    - body size: Number (0, 7) ? in/exclusive
    - trait cards: List of TraitCard (max 3)

    - left neighbor: SpeciesBoard or None
    - right neighbor: SpeciesBoard or None

TraitCard:
    - trait: Trait
    - food points: Number, (-8, 8) for carnivores else (-3, 3), ? in/exclusive

Trait:
	- trait id : a string unique to this trait.
	- type : TraitType (Indicates whether the trait conforms to a certain
	                    additional method.)

TraitType is an enum with 5 casesâ€” 4 are paired with an abstract method that
 classes that implement it will implement. Below, 'owner' indicates the owner
 of the trait; others are self explanatory.

- PreventsAttack
		 // Called to check if any species can attack another species.
		 // False will prevent the attack from being possible
	- method prevent_attack(attacker Species, attacked Species, owner species) -> Boolean

- WasAttacked
		// Called when any one species attacks another species.
		// The species may be altered as desired.
	- method was_attacked(attacker Species, attacked Species, owner Species) -> (Species, Species, Species)

- FoodRevealed
		// Called when the number of food available is revealed;
		// the owner may be altered, as may the number of food available.
	- method food_was_revealed(Number quantity, owner Species) -> (Number, Species)

- FoodEaten
		//Called when food is eaten by an herbivore; the number of food
		// available may be changed, and food may be placed.
	- method food_eaten(eater Species, quantity Number, owner Species) -> Number

- NoReaction
		// NoReaction traits, such as Carnivore, usually indicate that
		// the behavior will be implemented inside the Player.


3. Overview of the game

Whenever the following overview refers to the Player making a decision, it
means that the actual decision will be offloaded through a method call to a
PlayerAgent, which can be a human or an AI.

At the beginning of the game the Dealer randomly selects the starting Player
 and the order at which the other Players will play. This order does not change
 throughout the game. At the end of each turn the starting Player changes to the
 next Player in order.

At the beginning of a turn the Dealer gives a SpeciesBoard to every Player,
 who doesn't have any SpeciesBoards. This SpeciesBoard has a population of zero,
 which means that a TraitCard must be discarded by the Player in the same round
 for the species to survive. [1] Then the Dealer gives each Player in order
 3 TraitCards from the deck, and an additional TraitCard for each SpeciesBoard
 the Player has.

Each Player is then asked by the Dealer to discard a single card to the
 WateringHole. The Players can then directly assign up to 3 TraitCards to
 any of their SpeciesBoards, this action removes the cards from their hand.
 The Players can then discard any number of TraitCards from their hand to the
 discard pile (hand to the Dealer) and choose one of the following effects:
    * add 1 population to a single SpeciesBoard owned by the Player
    * add 1 body to a single SpeciesBoard owned by the Player
    * add 1 new SpeciesBoard either left or right of the existing boards
 Each of these effects will be represented by calling a different method on
 the dealer, with the card as the argument. The remaining cards stay in the
 Players' hands until they are played or until the end of the game.

After all Players have had their chance to use their TraitCards the feeding
 phase begins. The Dealer updates the WateringBoard to include food tokens
 from the discarded cards. The Dealer than asks each Player to return a
 SpeciesBoard to feed. This must be a valid feeding target, which means
 that it must either be a species with less food tokens than population.
 If the given species is a vegetarian, it is given a food token from the
 WateringHole by the Dealer. If the given species is a carnivore, then
 the PlayerAgents is given a list of valid targets for eating, based on
 the game rules. Target validity is determined by population/body sizes and
 the result of calling prevent_attack with the species on each trait on the
 board. The traits determine from the arguments whether they should activate
 or not.

The game ends and the winners are determined as specified in the requirements
analysis.


4. Ambiguities

* The population size is listed as 0,7 -- is that inclusive?
    (same for food point ranges and body sizes)
* The species board comes "without population token" -- does that
    just mean with a value of 0? (we assume yes.)
* In the end game, do we end when the turn after cards run out is finished,
    or do we end right after we hand out the last card before we'd have
    too few to deal?
* It is listed that 'vegetarian' cards must be fed from the watering hole --
    are these just all the cards that aren't carnivores? (We assume yes.)
* The Cooperation card uses the phrase "from the common food supply" --
    does that just mean the watering hole? (We assume yes.)
* "One player is randomly chosen as the first starting player; after that,
    the players become starting players in a round-robin fashion."
    Where does the order of the players come from? Is it also random, or is it
    given to the game in order?
* "During the game, each species board may be associated with up to three
    trait cards." Does this mean simultaneously, or in total -- that is, does
    the SB keep a history of TCs it's been associated with?
    (We assume simultaneously.)
* "At the beginning the dealer hands a species board to every player who
    does not have one; the board comes without population token. Each player
    also receives three trait cards plus one card per existing species."
    Does the board handed at the beginning of the game count as an
    'existing species'?
* When an attack would be prevented by a target's traits, is the attacker
    prevented from attacking, or are they allowed to attack but not able to
    make it happen?
* "A player arranges the species (boards) in a linear order." Is the player
    allowed to rearrange cards at any time? (We assume only when a new board
    is added)
* Can the watering hole's count of tokens go negative?
    (We assume no, and that it's capped at a minimum of zero.)
* If there are no food tokens, does a carnivore not get to eat?
    (We assume that they do not.)
* "the players feed their species in a round-robin fashion" Does this mean
    that each player feeds all of its species before the next player feeds
    one, or that each player feeds one species before one of the next
    player's species can feed? (We assume the latter.)
