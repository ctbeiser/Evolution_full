Purpose: Implement Dealer class and a method "feed_one" to handle feedings

dealer/dealer.py
	Contains a representation of the Dealer in the game
dealer/traitcard.py
	Contains a representation of Trait Cards in the game
dealer/feeding_intent.py
	Contains all possible feeding intents returnable by Player
dealer/player.py
	Contains a representation of Player in the game
dealer/species.py
	Contains a representation of Species boards in the game
Tests:
dealer/test_feeding_intent.py
	Tests for feeding_intent.py
dealer/test_player.py
	Tests for player.py
dealer/test_species.py
	Tests for species.py
feeding/trait.py
dealer/test_dealer.py
	Tests for dealer.py


test/*
	JSON Test files for project test harness. Input files are denoted as X-in.json, output files as X-out.json

rest.txt
	A wishlist of methods desired to complete the Player class

xstep.py
	A test harness for testing 'feed_one' method in Dealer. Accepts input from stdin and outputs to stdout

xstep
	A bash script that calls xstep.py
compile
	Exits with code 0

Code can be read by beginning with xstep.py which creates a Dealer object from data from stdin and calls the feed_one method. Continue reading into the dealer.py, specifically the feed_one method. Then read feeding_intent.py, specifically the implementation of the enact methods. 

The tests can be run with the following command:
    python3 -m unittest

 The xstep tests can be run from the assignment root with:
    for i in {1..5}; do ./xstep < test/$i-in.json | cmp test/$i-out.json; done
